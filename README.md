# Credit Card Fraud Detection Capstone Project
This Python project focuses on combating rising credit card fraud using machine learning to safeguard financial systems. Key highlights include:

✅ Fraud Detection System: Analyze a Kaggle dataset with 600k transactions, identifying fraudulent patterns effectively.

✅ Cost-Benefit Analysis: Reduce bank losses by implementing a second-layer authentication system for flagged transactions.

✅ Imbalanced Data Handling: Develop robust models to address fraud's rare occurrence (0.52% of transactions).



📊 Project Pipeline:
📂 EDA & Feature Engineering: Uncover patterns and optimize data for model performance.

📈 Model Training: Test algorithms and fine-tune parameters for optimal fraud detection accuracy.

💵 Savings Evaluation: Quantify benefits by comparing costs before and after model deployment.

This project highlights the power of machine learning in enhancing security and reducing financial risks in the banking sector. 🔍📉💡
